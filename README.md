# js-discovery
Collection of useful javascript / vue articles and tested libraries, packages and tools,

# Packages that can be found in (almost) any of my projects
Names will be taken from my ```package.json``` files because I want to minimize the chance to mix up something and because there are similar packages with almost the same names. Also, obvious packages linters and template compilers won't be seen here.

* simple-vue-validator
* vue-router-user-roles
* date-fns
* microtip
* js-cookie
* purgecss
* terser-webpack-plugin
* vue-json-pretty

# Other awesome packages and tools
I am familiar with awesome collections of packages and libraries related to [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/awesome-vue) and [Javascript](https://github.com/sorrycc/awesome-javascript). I consider them a good starting point for checking out some lesser known (awesome) packages that don't have a google-friendly name. Here you will find some packages that I've personally tested, liked and used in projects.

* cryptocurrency-address-validator
* countup.js
* numbro
* zxcvbn
* cryptocurrency-address-validator
* smart-css-grid
* json-server
* vue-content-loader
